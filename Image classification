In today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) stand at the forefront of innovation, driving transformative changes across various industries. 
Recognizing the significance of these fields, I pursued an internship through AICTE, where I had the privilege of working on AI and ML projects in collaboration with Google. 
This internship provided me with valuable hands-on experience, deepening my understanding of AI/ML concepts and enabling me to apply cutting-edge techniques to real-world problems.
